h3(#intro-and-description). Intro and description

p. A Textpattern plugin used for <abbr title="Search engine optimization">SEO</abbr>. The plugin includes basic SEO tools, from semi-automatic metainformation generation to useful redirections that prevent double content as rah_metas is also able redirect requested messy urls to cleans, leaving no space for the double content fault.

* *Outputs automatic metadescriptions* from article's body, excerpt or custom field.
* *Limits and customizes the automatic metadescription* by word or character limit, strips all XHTML and invalid characters.
* *Redirects messy urls to clean ones, if cleans are in use*. In example, @?id=xx@ and @?s=xx@ would be redirect to the correct place, preventing possible double content.

h3(#installation-and-usage). Installation and usage

p. The general behavior stands: paste plugin code to the plugin installer textarea and run the automatic setup. Then just activate the plugin and you are ready to use new tags that plugin includes like others.

p. For usage, basically just put @<txp:rah_metas />@-tag with wanted attributes to inside your site's @<head>@-tags. As the plugin's tag outputs metainformation, and meta-tags, it shouldn't be used outside @<head>@-tags.

h3(#attributes). Attributes

p. The tag is @<txp:rah_metas />@ and attributes for it follow. Default value @""@ means that the attribute is unset and defaultly non-used.

p. *description_from*
Which field we use for the automatic metadescription. Available values: @body@, @excerpt@ or @custom field's name@ that is set via Textpattern's preferences. If empty, then automatic description isn't used - only @description@-attribute instead, if it's filled and @description_replament@ is set on.

If custom_field is used for description, and @prefercontent@ is used, then description is tried to taken from excerpt and body untill it finds filled field. If @prefercontent@ is empty, this option isn't used, if filled used.
