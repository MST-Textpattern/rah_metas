p. For usage, basically just put @<txp:rah_metas />@-tag with wanted attributes to inside your site's @<head>@-tags. As the plugin's tag outputs metainformation, and meta-tags, it shouldn't be used outside @<head>@-tags.

h3(#example). Examples

p. *#1: Basic usage*

bc. <txp:rah_metas keywords="dog, cat, house" description="Lorem lipsum" maxchars="170" words="15" />

p. *#2: Using content preferring.* First look at the custom field, then main (excerpt, body) fields.

bc. <txp:rah_metas description_from="MyCustomFieldName,excerpt,body" />

p. *#3: Use rah_metas tag inside "article_custom":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=article_custom block*

p. If rah_metas is placed directly inside article_custom (or article) tag, it can be used to pull the meta data from that specific article.

bc. <txp:article_custom id="5">
	<txp:rah_metas />
</txp:article_custom>

In the code above, we took the meta data from the article where the ID is 5.

p. *#4: How to not output description at all, but keep all other features intact?*

bc. <txp:rah_metas description="" description_from="" />

p. If @description@ and @description_from@ are set empty, no description will be generated. Same applies to keywords (see @keywords@ and @keywords_from@ attributes).

* Some users wanted to be able input invalid characters to description: now it is possible, if you turn Textile off: why should we validate meta description, if article's body itself is invalid, because writer doesn't use valid HTML special characters.
